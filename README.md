### Redux

When you make new reducers, action creators and so on, follow the proposal
[Ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux). This guideline makes
less dirs/files in a project.

And, We use also [Flux Standard Action](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action) to design actions and action creators.
